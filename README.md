# 📝 Quiz Game 📝

Welcome to the Quiz Game! This project started as a simple quiz app in my first class, and it has evolved over time with added features and refinements. The game is designed in C++ and provides an interactive experience where players can answer questions across multiple topics and track their stats.

## ❗ Features ❗

- **Player Profiles**: Stores player names, ages, and scores.
- **Topic Ratings**: Tracks and displays players' scores across various topics.
- **Persistent Stats**: Stats are saved to a text file, preserving data between sessions.
- **Improved Interface**: Updated command-line interface for better user experience.
